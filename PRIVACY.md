# Privacy

Kodu collects telemetry when run.  This telemetry is anonymous.  It does not contain your user name or IP address.  We use this telemetry to better understand how users are interacting with Kodu's features.

## Disabling Telemetry
The gathering of usage data may be disabled during installation by unchecking the checkbox on the Privacy page of the installer.
Once Kodu is installed, the gathering of usage data can be controlled from a checkbox found on the Options page directly off the Main Menu.
